#pycryptosat  # Sage distribution installs it as part of cryptominisat. According to its README on https://pypi.org/project/pycryptosat/: "The pycryptosat python package compiles while compiling CryptoMiniSat. It cannot be compiled on its own, it must be compiled at the same time as CryptoMiniSat."
